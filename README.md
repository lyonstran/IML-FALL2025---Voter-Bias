## Project Goals

• Using these measures, analyze the ballot data from AP Top 25 College Football and Men’s Basket-
ball Polls for biases by voters towards (or against) specific teams.


• Determine if there are correlations between such biases and a voter’s geographic location, alma
mater team, or alma mater conference.
