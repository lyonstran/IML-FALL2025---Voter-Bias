## Project: Voter Biases in AP Top 25 Polls Fall 2025

- Faculty Mentor: AJ Hildebrand

- IML Scholars: Albert Bogdan, Lyons Tran

## Project Goals:

- Develop measures to quantiy voter biases in AP Top 25 polls in a statistically rigourous manner.

-  Using these measures, analyze the ballot data from AP Top 25 College Football and Men's Basketball Polls for biases by voters towards (or against) specific teams. 

- Determine if there are correlations between such biases and a voterâ€™s geographic location, alma mater team, or alma mater conference.

## Responsibilities

- Initially, all team members will collaborate on this project.

- At a later stage, the team may be split into subgroups, with each subgroup focusing on a different aspect of the project.
